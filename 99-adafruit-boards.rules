# udev rules for Adafruit's boards like Trinket, Gemma, Flora, Bluefruit Micro, etc.
#
# Copy this file to the location of your distribution's udev rules, for example on Ubuntu:
#   sudo cp adafruit-trinket.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
# Then reload udev configuration by executing:
#   sudo reload udev
# Or if that doesn't work try:
#   sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
#   sudo udevadm trigger

# Rule to make Trinket/Pro Trinket/Gemma/Flora programmable without running Arduino as root.
# Tested with Ubuntu 14.04 and 12.04.  Other distributions might need to update GROUP="dialout"
# to another group value like "users".
